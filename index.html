              Hello. I'm Kamran. I'm originally from Thousand Oaks, California, but have been living in Durham, North Carolina since 2014. I have a BA in Sociology from the University of California, Davis and I recently graduated from the Coding Bootcamp at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. My background is in QA, music and in project management at companies such as THQ, Warner Bros. Records, and Jakks Pacific. I am a drummer and have done a little touring and recording. I love football (go Pats) and fantasy football. My hobbies include playing the drums, reading, video games, anime, hiking, building computers and tech in general.
              </p>

              <p class="second-para">I'm fairly new to the world of web development, but I am really enjoying it so far. I have an almost insatiable thirst for knowledge in this field, and have been taking supplemental online classes and reading many articles about coding languages and new tech to further develop my skills and expand my knowledge.</p>
